if the data is skew in 1 catagory in the confusion matrix, sometime we get lower accuracy from the model than harcoding the outcome
=> accuracy paradox

CAP: cumulative accuracy profile
create a random model line -> gain chart: how much gain you get from the random model

-50% line intersection with the curve -> X
X>70% is usable
X>90% is overfitting
