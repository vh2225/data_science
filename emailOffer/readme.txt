Logistic Reg
- deal with bool data
- predict the probability
- s shape, level out at the 2 extremums

false pos (type I error), false neg (type II error)

Confusion Matrix: matrix of type 1 error vs type 2 error
- accuracy rate: AR = correct/total
- error rate: ER = wrong/total = 1-AR

Interpreting log_reg data:
- cannot use coefficient to quantify any effect
- coefficients can be used to compare which effect is greater
- z score: coef/std
